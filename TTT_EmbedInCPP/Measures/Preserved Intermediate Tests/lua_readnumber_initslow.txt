Reason to preserve: First time observed a high difference in the time between the first 2-3 samples and the rest (with a trend of the time lowering, stabilizing afterwards).

Conditions: 
 - TestRunner testRunner("readInCPP_simple_number.lua", "Measures/lua_read_number.txt", readNumber, 64, 1024, false);
 (samples = 64; runs per sample = 1024)
 - Same number read from Lua file every run and sample, no modifications ever between runs OR samples.

 Over additional attempts (~10 in the next 10 minutes):
 - Randomly the .txt from each attempt was either preserved or deleted (no significant differences from this action detected).    - Numbers read = 42; 1048573 (barely below 2^20); 1099511627773 (barely below 2^40) (no significant differences from this action detected).
